Built a Power BI dashboard with 25+ interactive visualizations for 5 Indian cities, integrating real-time weather and 7-day forecast data.  

Automated extraction, transformation, and modeling of key metrics—temperature, humidity, wind, AQI (CO, O3, SO2, NO2, PM2.5, PM10), rainfall probability, and sunrise/sunset—using Power Query and DAX.  

Enabled dynamic city selection, instant KPI updates, and robust scheduled refresh for always up-to-date insights in a modern, user-friendly design.
